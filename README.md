Introduction to Python Programming
=======================

Introduction to Python for non-programmers with a focus on plotting and data analysis.
Please see <https://tobyhodges.github.io/python-embl-jan-2020/>
for a rendered version of this material.

The material is largely based on two [Software Carpentry][swc] lessons:

- [Plotting & Programming with Python][python-novice-gapminder]
- [Programming with Python][python-novice-inflammation]

The lesson material was compiled by 
Mattia Forneris, Toby Hodges, and Nicolai Karcher
for teaching an [EMBL Bio-IT][bio-it] course at the [European Molecular Biology Laboratory][embl].
