# In Python, the // operator performs
# integer (whole-number) floor division,
# the / operator performs floating-point division,
# and the ‘%’ (or modulo) operator calculates and returns
#  the remainder from integer division:

print('5 // 3:', 5//3) # 1
print('5 / 3:', 5/3)   # 1.6666666666666667
print('5 % 3:', 5%3)   # 5 % 3: 2

# If num_subjects is the number of subjects taking part
# in a study, and num_per_survey is the number that can
# take part in a single survey, write an expression that
# calculates the number of surveys needed to reach everyone once.
