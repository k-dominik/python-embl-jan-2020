# There Are Many Ways To Import Libraries!

# Match the following print statements with the appropriate library calls.

# Print commands:

print("sin(pi/2) =", sin(pi/2))
print("sin(pi/2) =", m.sin(m.pi/2))
print("sin(pi/2) =", math.sin(math.pi/2))

# Library calls:

from math import sin, pi
import math
import math as m
from math import *
