# Identifying Variable Name Errors


# 1. Read the code below, and (without running it) try to identify what the errors are.
# 2. Run the code, and read the error message. 
#    What type of NameError do you think this is? 
#    In other words, is it a string with no quotes, 
#    a misspelled variable, 
#    or a variable that should have been defined but was not?
# 3. Fix the error.
# 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3, until you have fixed all the errors.

for number in range(10):
    # use a if the number is a multiple of 3, otherwise use b
    if (Number % 3) == 0:
        message = message + a
    else:
        message = message + "b"
print(message)
