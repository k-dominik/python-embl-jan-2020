#Earlier we saw this function:

def print_date(year, month, day):
    joined = str(year) + '/' + str(month) + '/' + str(day)
    print(joined)

#We saw that we can call the function using named arguments, like this:

print_date(day=1, month=2, year=2003)

# What does print_date(day=1, month=2, year=2003) print?
# When have you seen a function call like this before?
# When and why is it useful to call functions this way?
