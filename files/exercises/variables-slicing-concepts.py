# Slicing concepts

# 1. What does thing[low:high] do?
# 2. What does thing[low:] (without a value after the colon) do?
# 3. What does thing[:high] (without a value before the colon) do?
# 4. What does thing[:] (just a colon) do?
# 5. What does thing[number:some-negative-number] do?
# 6. What happens when you choose a high value which is out of range? (i.e., try atom_name[0:15])
