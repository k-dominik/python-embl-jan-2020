# Clean Up This Code

# 1. Read this short program and try to predict what it does.
# 2. Run it: how accurate was your prediction?
# 3. Refactor the program to make it more readable.
#    Remember to run it after each change to ensure its
#    behavior hasn’t changed.
# 4. Compare your rewrite with your neighbor’s.
#    What did you do the same? What did you do differently, and why?
