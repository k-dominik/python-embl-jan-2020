# Spot the Difference

# 1. Predict what each of the print statements in the program
#   below will print.
# 2. Does max(len(rich), poor) run or produce an error message?
#   If it runs, does its result make any sense?

easy_string = "abc"
print(max(easy_string))
rich = "gold"
poor = "tin"
print(max(rich, poor))
print(max(len(rich), len(poor)))
